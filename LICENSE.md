# Licensing

## Commercial Use

Without express permission -- which is nigh impossible to obtain -- you shall not make money off distributing this mod, source or compiled.
That includes, but is not limited to the following:

- ads on your site or ad gateways for downloads
- direct sales
- membership fees where someone must be a member to get access to the code or mod
- any other direct or indirect methods of making money
- making money in the above ways from tutorials containing code from this mod
- making money in the above ways from derivatives of this mod

You may make money from the following:

- make youtube videos featuring the mod in action
- talk about the mod (without featuring code from the mod)
- feature a pay-to-play/pay-to-win server with the mod,
 where users must obtain the mod in order to play, as long as they can obtain the mod without paying or viewing ads.
- Derivative Works _(for noncommercial use, skip this and see below)_
  - Any work deriving from this (where money is made) MUST be substantially different from the original mod, at the discretion of the original author
  - Good Examples (What you may do):
    - looking at the source code of this mod to see how MinecraftForge, Java, Minecraft, etc work.
    - emulating some parts of the coding structure to make your own mod easier
    - MAYBE (this may change): Mods that require my mod as a whole.  Not sure on that yet.
  - Bad Examples (What you may not do):
    - Copying textures
    - Copying "books" (guidebooks, lore books, etc)
    - Copying the mechanics

## NonCommercial Use

Restrictions:

- No money is to be made from the following uses

You are free to do any of the following:

- make youtube videos featuring the mod in action
- make modpacks (Credit must be given)
- study modding
- teach modding (Credit must be given)
- Derivative Works
  - Mods that extend this mod and require or hook into this mod
  - Mods that emulate this mod, so long as they give credit to the original (Dartania Thorne / Shelby Kauth)
  
You MAY NOT:

- make a substantially similar mod to replace this mod on Curse for public distribution (This may change in the future when I decide I'm done modding.  But until then, no.)

## Substantially Similiar Derivative Works

This is of course where it's wishy washy.  The following tips will keep us separate.  Following all is not necessary, but the more you follow, the less stress for all involved (and the more fun and unique our culture will become).  

Keep in mind, if you're making this for just yourself and friends (not publishing online for all, not making money from it), or as a free tutorial, it can be as similar as you want.

**To Avoid Substantial Similarity:**

- Do NOT use my textures.  DO draw your own.
- Do NOT copy my code.  DO write your own.
- Do NOT copy my mechanics.  DO make your own.
- Do NOT copy any unique text/lore/strings.  DO write your own.

## Final Notes

### _If you see something wrong with the license, these are my goals:_

If I disappear like Eminoph did (or other mod authors in the Minecraft 1.7 era), I would love to see my mod continued and cared for, even if that means I'm no longer on the project and other people are coding my baby.  But if I don't disappear like that, I would appreciate it greatly if people would send their desired changes to me, instead of running off and putting forks of it onto CurseForge.  
I know this is a touchy subject for a lot of modders, but I hope that this license provides a clear distinction between the two sides of the debate.  If it doesn't, please raise a Github Issue to address the problem.

I am a first-time modder, and I don't have much experience with this sort of stuff.  If I do step on someone else's toes, please know that I do not mean to!  If my tone is inappropriate, I also do not mean for it to be.  If this license is too restrictive to be of use (CurseForge, major free modpacks, that sort of thing), that is a major issue, and I really don't mean for that to happen.  
If you see these problems, please politely inform me of such and I will do my best to correct the issue.
